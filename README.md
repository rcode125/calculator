# Simple Calculator

A minimal, accessible calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Percent support (e.g. "50%" -> 0.5)
- Clear (C) and Backspace (⌫)
- Keyboard support (digits, + - * /, Enter for equals, Backspace, Escape for clear)
- Responsive and lightweight

Files:
- index.html — markup and UI
- styles.css — styling
- script.js — calculator logic and keyboard handling

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click buttons or use your keyboard to type expressions, then press `=` or Enter to evaluate.

Notes:
- The calculator sanitizes input before evaluation but is intended for local/static usage.
- For more advanced parsing or security-critical use, replace the simple evaluator with a full expression parser.
